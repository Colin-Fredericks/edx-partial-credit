# edx-partial-credit

This project adds partial credit to several problem types:
* Multiple Choice
* Checkbox
* Dropdown
* Numerical
* Custom Python (aka Write-Your-Own-Grader)

This repository stores the files that one would need to make this happen. It's mostly here as a legacy item at this point, since the feature has now been merged into the [edx-platform](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/) master branch!

For in-depth information, take a look at the [EdX Partial Credit Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CZwqG5WdQreFoZMiIxezQMh5KDtjHy7xEWKwJ71F9w/edit?usp=sharing)
